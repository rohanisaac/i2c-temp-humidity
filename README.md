# Sensor
The HIH8120-021-001 is a Digital Humidity/Temperature Sensor are digital output-type relative humidity (RH) and temperature sensors combined in the same package. 

The output of this sensor is I2C.

The sensor I used was purchased form [Newark](http://www.newark.com/honeywell/hih8120-021-001/humidity-digital-2-rh-sip-4/dp/04X4284) for about $9.
